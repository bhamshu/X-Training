# X-Training
I blatantly ripped off the design of a game called X-Training and reverse engineered it. I don't know who to give credit so I'm including the original game, which btw I received from my brother, in the repo. 
If you want to just play my game, download any of the application.windows folder in its entirety and run the executable file. If you want to play the **original game**, download **x-training.swf**.
